"""   Given two arrays A and B of equal size, the advantage of A with respect to B
   is the number of indices i for which A[i] > B[i].
   
   Return any permutation of A that maximizes its advantage with respect to B.
   
   
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11] Output: [2,11,7,15]
  
   IDEA:
   Only relative order does matter, so one can apply greedy approach here
   Sort both arrays, and find the
