"""   Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of
   non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions: The substrings
   do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[k..l], either j
   < k or i > l is true. A substring that contains a certain character c must
   also contain all occurrences of c. Find the maximum number of substrings that
   meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same
   number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be
   shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length. Notice
   that you can return the substrings in any order. 
   
   Example 1: Input: s =
   "adefaddaccc" 
   Output: ["e","f","ccc"] 
   
   Explanation: The following are all the
   possible substrings that meet the conditions: 
   [ 
   "adefaddaccc" 
   "adefadda",
   "ef", 
   "e", 
   "f", 
   "ccc", 
   ]
