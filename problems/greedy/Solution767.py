"""   Given a string S, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two
   characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.
   
   If possible, output any possible result. If not possible, return the empty
   string.
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: S = "aab" Output: "aba"
   
   IDEA:
   use the most frequent letters first
