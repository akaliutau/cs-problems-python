"""   Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
   Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another
   expression. Note: Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
   The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would
   always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.
   
   Example 1: Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"] Output: 9 Explanation: ((2 + 1) *
   3) = 9
   
   IDEA:
   strait-forward: pop 2 values from stack, reduce and push back
