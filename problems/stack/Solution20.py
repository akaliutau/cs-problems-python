"""   Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
   determine if the input string is valid.
   
   An input string is valid if:
   
   Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must
   be closed in the correct order.
   
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: s = "()" Output: true
   
   IDEA:
   1) add only opening brackets to the stack
   2) if bracket is from closing set, try to match with the top of stack
   3) in the end check stack for emptiness
