"""   A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. 
   The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
   If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. 
   Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
