"""   A sequence X_1, X_2, ..., X_n is fibonacci-like if: n >= 3 X_i + X_{i+1} =
   X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n Given a strictly increasing array A of positive
   integers forming a sequence, find the length of the dp fibonacci-like
   subsequence of A. If one does not exist, return 0. (Recall that a subsequence
   is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements
   (including none) from A, without changing the order of the remaining
   elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)
   
   Example 1: Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] Output: 5 Explanation: The dp
   subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8]
   
   IDEA: use the pair transitioning as a key for dp
