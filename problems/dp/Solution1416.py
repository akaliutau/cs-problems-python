"""   A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to
   print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits and all we
   know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are
   no leading zeros in the array.
   
   Given the string s and the integer k. There can be multiple ways to restore
   the array.
   
   Return the number of possible array that can be printed as a string s using
   the mentioned program.
   
   The number of ways could be very large so return it modulo 10^9 + 7
   
   
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: s = "1000", k = 10000 Output: 1 Explanation: The only possible array
   is [1000] Example 2:
   
   Input: s = "1000", k = 10 Output: 0 Explanation: There cannot be an array
   that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
