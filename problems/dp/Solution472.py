"""   Given a list of words (without duplicates), write a program that
   returns all concatenated words in the given list of words. A concatenated
   word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two
   shorter words in the given array.
   
   Examples: 
   Input:
   ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

   Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats";
   "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; "ratcatdogcat"
   can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
