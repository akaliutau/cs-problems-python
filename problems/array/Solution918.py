"""   Given a circular array C of integers represented by a, find the maximum
   possible sum of a non-empty subarray of C. 
   
   Here, a circular array means the
   end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. (Formally, C[i] =
   a[i] when 0 <= i < a.length, and C[i+a.length] = C[i] when i >= 0.) also, a
   subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer a at most once.
   (Formally, for a subarray C[i], C[i+1], ..., C[j], there does not exist i <=
   k1, k2 <= j with k1 % a.length = k2 % a.length.) 
   
   Example 1: Input:
   [1,-2,3,-2] Output: 3 Explanation: Subarray [3] has maximum sum 3
