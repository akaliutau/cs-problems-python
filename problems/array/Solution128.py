"""   Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
   consecutive elements sequence. Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
   
   Example: Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest
   consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4
   
   IDEA: find the beginning of some sequence
   as a result the total time complexity will be O(n) - if contains operation is O(1)
