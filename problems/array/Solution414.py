"""   Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this
   array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity
   must be in O(n). 
   
   Example 1: Input: [3, 2, 1] Output: 1 Explanation: The third
   maximum is 1.
   
   IDEA:
   introduce a limit for max function
