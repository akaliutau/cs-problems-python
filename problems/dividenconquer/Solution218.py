"""   A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the
   buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given
   the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo
   (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings
   collectively (Figure B)
   
   The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of
   integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and
   right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is
   guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You
   may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely
   flat surface at height 0.
   
   For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [
   [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ]
   
   For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3
   15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ]
