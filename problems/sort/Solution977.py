"""   Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array
   of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order. 
   
   Example 1:
   Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10] Output: [0,1,9,16,100] 
   
   Explanation: After
   squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes
   [0,1,9,16,100].
   
   IDEA:
   merge 2 arrays for numbers < 0 and numbers > 0
   dynamically form arrays - i.e. do not generate intermediate one
