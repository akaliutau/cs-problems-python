"""   
   Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
   
   IDEA:
   
   growing intervals - 
   
   try to grow interval as much as possible (until there is intersection)
   
   when such situation has been reached, add completed interval to the answer list
   
   NOTE: sorting by left edge is needed
   
   Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
   Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
