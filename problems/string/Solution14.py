"""   
   Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
   strings.
   
   If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
   
   
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"] Output: "fl"
   
   IDEA:
    take the 1st word as a prefix, then decrease the length each time the divergence is found
    NOTE: the order is not important, as well as the relative length of the 1st word
