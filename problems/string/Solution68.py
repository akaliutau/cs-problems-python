"""   Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each
   line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
   You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words
   as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each
   line has exactly maxWidth characters. Extra spaces between words should be
   distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not
   divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned
   more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text, it should
   be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words. 
   
   Input: words
   = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."] maxWidth =
   16 
   
   Output: 
   [ 
   "This is an", 
   "example of text", 
   "justification. " 
   ]
   
   IDEA:
   try to add as many words as possible, until max size has reached, then start a new line
