"""   Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
   around its center).
   
   For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
   
         1 
        / \ 
       2   2
      / \ / \ 
     3  4 4  3
   
   
   But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
   
       1 
      / \ 
     2   2 
     \    \ 
      3    3
   
   IDEA: traverse the second tree in the opposite branches on EACH level
