"""   Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any
   subtree of that tree.
   
   (A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The
   average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of
   nodes.)
   
   IDEA:
   just collect state during traversing
   for each node calculate the avg using stats about childs + current node
