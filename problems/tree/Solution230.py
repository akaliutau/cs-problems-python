"""   Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
   smallest element in it. 
   
   Example 1: Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1 
   
      3 
     / \
    1   4 
     \ 
      2 
      
      Output: 1
      
   IDEA:
   1) use mapping of BST to the array - the array will be already sorted in asc order
   2) the kth Smallest element will be [k-1]
