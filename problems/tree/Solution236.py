"""   
   Tree
   
   Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given curNodes in the tree.
   
   IDEA:
   closest common ancestor is a fork point
   
   there are 3 forks possible:
   1) both given nodes are in the same branch - the  LCA will be the highest node
   2) given nodes are in different branches - the  LCA will be the fork node
