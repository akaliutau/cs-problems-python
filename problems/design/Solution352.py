"""   
   Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, ...,
   summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals. 
   For example, suppose the integers from the data stream are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, ...,
   then the summary will be: 
   1 [1, 1] 
   3 [1, 1], [3, 3] 
   7 [1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 7] 
   2 [1, 3], [7, 7]              // case 1
   6 [1, 3], [6, 7]              // case 2
