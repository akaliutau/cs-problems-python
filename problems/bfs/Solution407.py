"""   Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each
   unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to
   trap after raining. 
   
   Example: 
   Given the following 3x6 height map: 
   [
   [1,4,3,1,3,2], 
   [3,2,1,3,2,4], 
   [2,3,3,2,3,1] 
   ] 
   Return 4.
   
   IDEA:
   1) in 2D water leaks using the lowest level => start from
    a) boundaries
    b) lowest walls
    
    start BFS from multiple sources (boundary cells)
