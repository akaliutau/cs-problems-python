"""   In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer
   representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
   
   Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
   
   Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that
   cell.

   You can't visit the same cell more than once. 
   
   Never visit a cell with 0 gold. 
   
   You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid
   that has some gold.
   
   
   Example 1:
