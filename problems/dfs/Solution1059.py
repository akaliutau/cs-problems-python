"""   Given the edges of a directed graph where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates there
   is an edge between nodes ai and bi, and two nodes source and destination of
   this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from source
   eventually, end at destination, that is:
   
   At least one path exists from the source node to the destination node 
   
   If a path exists from the source node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that
   node is equal to destination. The number of possible paths from source to
   destination is a finite number. Return true
   
   IDEA:
   1) create a graph of interlinked nodes
   2) invoke dfs on this graph
