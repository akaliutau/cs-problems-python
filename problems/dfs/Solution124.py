"""   Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
   
   For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting
   node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path
   must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
   
   Input: root = [1,2,3] Output: 6
   
   IDEA:
    2 cases are possible
   1) path from root till leaf
   2) path from some leaf to another leaf
