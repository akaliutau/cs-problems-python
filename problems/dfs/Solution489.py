"""   Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid. Each cell in the grid can
   be empty or blocked. The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward,
   turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees. When it tries to
   move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays
   on the current cell. Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only
   the 4 given APIs shown below. 
   
   Example: 
   
   Input: room = 
   [ 
   [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
   [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1], 
   [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1], 
   [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0], 
   [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] 
   ],
   row = 1, col = 3 
   
   Explanation: All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or
   1. 0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible. The
   robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3. From the top left
   corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
