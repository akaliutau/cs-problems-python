"""   Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's
   sum equals the given sum. Note: A leaf is a node with no children. Example:
   Given the below binary tree and sum = 22, 
            5 
           / \ 
          4   8 
         /   / \ 
       11   13  4 
      / \      / \ 
     7   2    5   1 
     
     Return: [ 
     [5,4,11,2], 
     [5,8,4,5] 
     ]
     
     IDEA:
     1) traverse a dynamic list with path and separate variable with partial sum
