"""   There are n network nodes, labelled 1 to n.
   
   Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w),
   where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes
   for a signal to travel from source to target.
   
   now, we send a signal from a certain node k. How long will it take for all
   nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.
   
   Example 1
   
   Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 Output: 2
