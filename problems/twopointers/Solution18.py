"""   Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements
   a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? 
   Find all unique quadruples in the array which gives the sum of target. 
   
   Notice that the
   solution set must not contain duplicate quadruples. 
   
   Example 1: Input: nums =
   [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0 Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]
   
   IDEA:
   reduce the problem to n-1 case, then n-2 down to n = 2 for a list of sorted numbers
