"""   Given an array arr of integers and integer K, return the maximum S such that
   there exists i < j with arr[i] + arr[j] = S and S < K. 
   If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.
   
   
   
   Example 1:
   
   Input: arr = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60 Output: 58 Explanation: We can
   use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
   
   IDEA:
   sort array and advance either left or right boundary
